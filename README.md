# Data Mining Project

In this project we are gathering the data from CSVs, preprocess the data in order to clean it and make it ready, and finally apply: 
      - Regression, 
      - Classification, 
      - Clustering. 
      
Finally we get the results after applying our models and make some visualizations.

A GUI is implemented to allow the user to choose the needed regression algorithm, the options are:
    • Linear Regression,
    • Decision Tree,
    • Polynomial Regression,
    • KNN Regression,
    • Random Forest.
    
Also, allow the user to choose the needed classification algorithm, the options are:
    • KNN,
    • Decision Tree,
    • Naive Bayes,
    • Random Forest.
    
And finally the only implemented clustring algorithm is:
    • K-means.

The GUI also allow the user to choose the way dealing with the missing values, options are:
    • Drop,
    • Replace with Mean,
    • Replace with Mode.
    
Also, the GUI allow the user to choose the scaling methods, options are:
    • Standard Scaler,
    • MinMax Scaler,
    • MaxScaler,
    • Robust Scaler.

Classification is applied on the cancer dataset, Regression is applied on diamonds dataset, and Clustering is applied on the iris dataset. 
In the report attached we are discussing our implementation, the added features, you will also find a user guide, and some test cases. 
At the end you will find our codes. Anyway, I hope this quick introduction has helped you.
